# Nucleus Portal

Clubs in college would
send google forms to fill for registration
of events which was quite long process so I decided to create a portal in which user with click of a button can register and browse other events in the college   
   
User just needs to add details in their profile page and then user can register for various events without hectic task of filling different forms.
